# AI Content Moderation Toolkit

## Overview

The **AI Content Moderation Toolkit** is a web-based application built using Gradio and AI Agents that provides two key functionalities:

1. **Spam Detection** - Identifies whether a given text is spam or not.
2. **Fact Checking** - Verifies the truthfulness of a claim based on provided evidence.

This project is designed to help automate content moderation, ensuring reliability and accuracy in digital communication.
